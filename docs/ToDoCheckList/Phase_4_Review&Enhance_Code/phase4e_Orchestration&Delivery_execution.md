# Phase 4E - Orchestration and Delivery Execution Plan

## 1. Purpose

This document translates the approved Phase 4 orchestration and delivery baseline into an implementation scope, impact analysis, task breakdown, and verifiable acceptance criteria.

Phase 4E covers:

1. Implement a health/readiness gate.
2. Replace the bootstrap placeholder with an idempotent bootstrap and schema readiness check.
3. Create `PipelineRunner` and a documented CLI.
4. Add process exit codes and machine-readable summary reports.
5. Mark integration tests and establish CI checks.
6. Update README, runbook, checklist, and operational evidence.

Phase 4E coordinates the completed or approved Bronze, Silver, and Gold boundaries. It does not duplicate their transformation, retry, staging, or validation mechanics.

### 1.1 Approved decisions

The following decisions are the implementation contract for Phase 4E. Where earlier sections differ, these decisions take precedence.

| Topic | Approved decision |
|---|---|
| Canonical orchestration | Extend the existing `PipelineRunner` and keep one production orchestration path. `PipelineRunner` coordinates stages; it does not reimplement Bronze, Silver, or Gold mechanics. |
| Gold ownership | `GoldJob` owns Gold build, integrity validation, constraints, KPI validation, version publication, and current-pointer update. The runner invokes the job and evaluates its final result; it does not duplicate Gold validation. |
| Full-run partial policy | In a full pipeline, any required Bronze target failure blocks Silver and Gold. `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` is not downstream-eligible. `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` is allowed only when rejection policy permits it. |
| Status and exit code | `SUCCESS` and policy-approved `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` return exit code `0`. `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` and `FAILED` return non-zero for a full pipeline. |
| Readiness ordering | Before bootstrap, validate Settings and dependency connectivity only. After bootstrap, validate schemas, required tables, metadata, and compatible versions before data-stage mutation. |
| Stage selection | `full` runs health -> bootstrap -> Bronze -> Silver -> Silver gate -> Gold. Standalone Silver requires an explicit valid Bronze snapshot/recovery input. Standalone Gold requires an explicit valid Silver `source_snapshot_id`; it must not auto-discover the latest snapshot. Unsupported combinations fail before mutation. |
| Snapshot propagation | The runner passes `source_snapshot_id` and upstream stage identity into Gold without loss. Gold results retain `pipeline_snapshot_id`, `source_snapshot_id`, `gold_run_id`, `gold_load_id`, `gold_version`, current-pointer state, KPI state, and publication state. |
| Gold failure | Gold failure returns pipeline `FAILED` with `failed_stage="gold"`; Bronze and Silver are not rolled back, and the previous valid Gold version remains active. |
| Application compatibility | Preserve the dictionary-returning application behavior through `run_application() -> dict`; provide a CLI-facing `main() -> int` and use `SystemExit` at the process boundary. |
| Report delivery | JSON and Markdown are renderings of the same structured result. Report generation failure is a non-success delivery outcome and must not be silently treated as pipeline success. |
| Integration prerequisites | Local unit selection may skip unavailable external services with an explicit reason. Production DoD remains blocked/non-success until required integration evidence exists or the blocker is recorded. |

### 1.2 Stage and exit-code policy

The full pipeline distinguishes terminal statuses as follows:

| Status | Meaning | Full-pipeline downstream eligibility | Exit code |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `SUCCESS` | All required stages pass without approved rejection | Yes | `0` |
| `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` | Required stages pass and rejected rows remain within policy | Yes | `0` |
| `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` | A stage or domain did not fully complete, even if policy records partial context | No | Non-zero |
| `FAILED` | A required gate, stage, validation, publication, or delivery step failed | No | Non-zero |

`PARTIAL_SUCCESS` may be represented for diagnostics or an explicitly supported recovery operation, but it cannot satisfy the full-pipeline success policy.

### 1.3 Readiness and stage-selection rules

Readiness is split into two gates:

```text
Settings validation
  -> pre-bootstrap connectivity check
      -> idempotent bootstrap
          -> post-bootstrap schema/table/metadata/version readiness
              -> data stages
```

The runner must reject these selections before mutation:

```text
full   -> health -> bootstrap -> Bronze -> Silver -> Silver gate -> Gold
bronze -> health -> bootstrap -> Bronze
silver -> explicit valid Bronze snapshot/recovery input required
gold   -> explicit valid Silver source_snapshot_id required
```

Standalone Silver and Gold runs must not infer a missing upstream snapshot from the latest available database state.

## 2. Dependencies and target workflow

Phase 4E depends on:

- Phase 4A settings, shared result/status contracts, and domain ownership.
- Phase 4B Bronze jobs, audit, quarantine, staging, publish, retry, and reconciliation.
- Phase 4C Silver job, validation gate, snapshot/load contract, and published-table metadata.
- Phase 4D Gold job, pre-publish integrity/KPI validation, constraints, versioned publication, and current pointer.

Target execution order:

```text
load and validate Settings
    -> health/readiness gate
        -> idempotent bootstrap and schema version check
            -> Bronze domain jobs
                -> Silver transformation
                    -> Silver snapshot gate
                        -> GoldJob
                            -> Gold build, integrity/KPI validation, and current-pointer publication
                                    -> summary report and exit code
```

A failed configuration, connectivity/readiness check, bootstrap, required Bronze domain, Silver transformation/gate, GoldJob, or report-delivery step must produce a non-success result and prevent unsafe downstream execution.

## 3. Baseline and current implementation

### 3.1 Confirmed implementation surface

| Area | Current location | Current behavior | Phase 4E concern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application entrypoint | `main.py` | Creates `App()` and returns `app.run()` | Does not expose CLI options or convert result to process exit code |
| Application orchestration | `src/app/app.py` | Runs health check, placeholder bootstrap, and Bronze only | No complete Silver/Gold lifecycle, stage contract, failure policy, or summary |
| Health service | `src/shared/services/connection_health_service.py` | Checks SQL Server/PostgreSQL and returns `ok`/`degraded` | Health result does not currently gate bootstrap or data processing |
| Bootstrap | `src/jobs/platform_bootstrap.py` | Returns a hard-coded success response | Does not create/check schemas, metadata, migrations, or schema version |
| Silver | `scripts/transformation/silver/sales_silver_clean.py` | Standalone full-table transformation | Phase 4C must expose an injectable job for the runner |
| Gold | `scripts/warehouse/postgres/gold/sales_gold_load.py` | Standalone destructive loader | Phase 4D must expose safe job/service for the runner |
| Result contract | `src/shared/ingestion/ingestion_models.py` | Shared ingestion statuses and table result shape | Runner needs stage/pipeline result aggregation without losing table context |
| Test configuration | `pytest.ini` | Defines `pythonpath` and `testpaths` only | No `integration` marker or default unit/integration policy |
| CI | Repository root | No `.github` directory/workflow was found | Quality checks are not automated |
| Documentation | `README.md`, Phase 4 docs | Bronze/foundation workflow is described | One-command execution, recovery, exit codes, and CI are not documented |

### 3.2 Falsifiable orchestration hypothesis

The primary orchestration defect is that `App.run()` ignores health status when deciding whether to execute bootstrap and Bronze. A fake service test that returns degraded health and records calls should show that bootstrap and all data jobs are not invoked. A second fake-stage test should show that a failed Silver validation prevents Gold invocation. If either test records downstream calls, the gate belongs in the runner boundary rather than in individual jobs.

### 3.3 Compatibility surface

Unless a separate compatibility decision is recorded, preserve:

- `App(bootstrap_job=None, health_service=None, bronze_job=None, settings=None)` construction and `App.run()` availability.
- The existing application invocation remains available through a dictionary-returning application function; the process-facing `main() -> int` is the CLI boundary and exits through `SystemExit`.
- `PlatformBootstrapJob.run()` as a callable bootstrap surface, with its response evolved compatibly where practical.
- Existing Bronze/Silver/Gold job and script entrypoints through delegating adapters.
- Existing test commands and import paths during migration.

Compatibility wrappers must delegate to the new runner or service and must not contain a second orchestration implementation.

## 4. Target architecture and contracts

### 4.1 Component boundaries

| Component | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Settings boundary | Load `.env`, process overrides, typed validation, safe summary | Stage execution or connection retry |
| Health/readiness service | Pre-bootstrap dependency connectivity and post-bootstrap schema/table/metadata/version readiness report | Starting data jobs |
| `PlatformBootstrapJob` | Idempotent schemas, metadata tables, migrations, version check | Transforming or publishing data |
| `PipelineRunner` | Stage order, stage gates, failure policy, result aggregation, report generation, and Gold result propagation | Bronze/Silver/Gold transformation, validation, retry, staging, or publication mechanics |
| CLI adapter | Parse mode/stage/log/report options and map result to exit code | Reimplementing runner behavior |
| Stage jobs | Their own transformation/loading contract | Calling unrelated downstream stages |
| Summary reporter | JSON/Markdown serialization of run evidence | Hiding or rewriting failed status |
| Test/CI configuration | Unit/integration selection and quality commands | Making unavailable external services look successful |

### 4.2 Pipeline result contract

`PipelineRunner.run()` must return a machine-readable result with at least:

```text
run_id, pipeline_name, mode, requested_stages,
status, started_at, finished_at, duration_ms,
health, bootstrap, stages, failed_stage,
rows_read, rows_written, rows_rejected,
error_type, error_message, report_paths
```

The nested Gold result must preserve the Phase 4D contract without flattening away lineage:

```text
pipeline_snapshot_id, source_snapshot_id,
gold_run_id, gold_load_id, gold_version,
current_pointer, published, kpi_passed,
constraints_verified, previous_version
```

Each stage result must preserve its standard table/batch results and include:

```text
stage, status, started_at, finished_at,
duration_ms, counts, errors, publication_state
```

Terminal statuses are `SUCCESS`, `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS`, `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, and `FAILED`. A pipeline is exit-code success only when every required stage satisfies its success policy. Report serialization must use the same structured result for JSON and Markdown and must not recalculate status independently.

### 4.3 Required stage policy

| Condition | Runner behavior | Terminal result |
|---|---|---|
| Settings validation fails | Stop before health check | `FAILED` |
| Health/readiness fails | Do not run bootstrap or data stages | `FAILED` |
| Bootstrap fails/version incompatible | Do not run data stages | `FAILED` |
| Bronze domain has allowed partial failure | Record all domain results; in a full run, any missing/failed required target blocks Silver and Gold | `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` or `FAILED` |
| Required Bronze failure | Stop before Silver | `FAILED` |
| Silver transformation fails | Do not run Silver validation or Gold | `FAILED` |
| Silver validation fails | Do not run Gold | `FAILED` |
| Gold build/validation/publish fails | Preserve prior Gold; no success exit | `FAILED` |
| All required stages pass with no rejection | Write reports and return exit code `0` | `SUCCESS` |
| Approved rejected rows within policy | Write reports and return exit code `0` | `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` |
| Partial stage/domain completion in full run | Preserve diagnostic context but do not claim downstream success | `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, non-zero |

## 5. Impact analysis

### 5.1 Code and runtime impact

| Impacted area | Expected change | Risk | Mitigation/evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `App` | Delegate to `PipelineRunner` while preserving constructor and `run()` | Existing callers may expect current result keys | Compatibility test for constructor, result shape, and injected fakes |
| Health gate | Treat Settings and dependency connectivity as a pre-bootstrap hard precondition, then run schema/version readiness after bootstrap | Partial processing may already occur if gate is late or readiness is checked at the wrong boundary | Tests assert zero bootstrap/data calls on connectivity failure and zero data calls on post-bootstrap readiness failure |
| Bootstrap | Replace hard-coded response with idempotent schema/metadata/version operations | Existing database may have partial or older objects | Migration/version tests, non-destructive rerun test, explicit incompatible-version failure |
| Stage wiring | Inject Bronze/Silver/Gold jobs and gate/report services | Hidden constructor defaults can make tests require live services or duplicate Gold validation | Dependency injection, fake-stage tests, and GoldJob ownership test |
| CLI | Add `full`, `incremental` where supported, stage selection, log level, report path, and help | Invalid options could silently select unsafe behavior | Parser tests and strict mode validation |
| Exit status | Map pipeline result to process code while preserving dictionary-returning application compatibility | Automation may treat degraded/partial result as success or break existing callers | `run_application() -> dict`, `main() -> int`, exit-code matrix, and subprocess smoke test |
| Reports | Generate JSON and Markdown from one structured result | Reports may omit failed stage, expose secrets, or fail after pipeline completion without affecting outcome | Fixture tests, schema assertions, redaction tests, and report-failure policy test |
| Pytest | Register `integration` marker and separate default commands | Local test run may hit unavailable services | Marker configuration and `pytest -m "not integration"` evidence |
| CI | Add unit, lint, format, type-check, and integration-aware jobs | CI environment may lack database prerequisites | Local unit selection may skip with explicit reason; Production DoD remains blocked/non-success without integration evidence |
| Documentation | Update README, runbook, checklist, and evidence | Docs can drift from CLI behavior | Command/help output and documented recovery steps reviewed together |

### 5.2 Operational impact

- Operators receive one documented command for a full run and explicit stage-selection commands for recovery.
- Settings/connectivity failures stop processing before bootstrap; post-bootstrap schema, metadata, and version readiness failures stop processing before Bronze, Silver, or Gold mutation.
- Every run has a stable `run_id`, stage status, timing, counts, failure context, report path, and exit code.
- A failed stage or report-delivery failure does not masquerade as a successful pipeline because a report was generated.
- Stage selection must respect dependencies. Running Silver alone requires an explicit valid Bronze snapshot/recovery input; running Gold alone requires an explicit valid Silver `source_snapshot_id` and must not auto-discover the latest snapshot.
- Reports contain safe metadata only; passwords, connection strings with credentials, and raw payloads are excluded.
- Integration failures caused by unavailable PostgreSQL/SQL Server are classified as environment prerequisites, not converted into passing evidence. Local unit runs may skip them with an explicit reason; the Production DoD remains blocked until evidence exists or the blocker is recorded.

### 5.3 Out of scope and decisions required

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| New transformation logic | Out of scope; owned by Phase 4B-4D stage jobs |
| Scheduler deployment | Out of scope; CLI and exit code must be scheduler-ready |
| Cloud secrets manager | Out of scope; use centralized Settings contract and document secret injection boundary |
| Unsupported partial stage runs | Must fail clearly; do not infer missing upstream snapshots |
| Domain partial-success policy | In a full run, required Bronze target failure blocks Silver/Gold; `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` is diagnostic only and is never full-pipeline success |
| Migration rollback policy | Bootstrap must document compatible version checks and non-destructive recovery; destructive rollback is not implicit |

## 7. Verifiable acceptance criteria

### 7.1 Health and bootstrap

- [ ] Settings are loaded and validated before health checks or stage execution.
- [ ] Pre-bootstrap checks cover Settings and configured SQL Server/PostgreSQL connectivity.
- [ ] Post-bootstrap readiness checks cover required schemas, tables, metadata, and compatible versions.
- [ ] Connectivity failure prevents bootstrap and all downstream calls; post-bootstrap readiness failure prevents Bronze, Silver, and Gold calls.
- [ ] Bootstrap creates/checks required schemas and metadata idempotently.
- [ ] Bootstrap records and validates schema version; incompatible versions fail clearly and non-destructively.
- [ ] Bootstrap rerun does not drop or replace published data.

### 7.2 Runner and pipeline gates

- [ ] `PipelineRunner` executes the documented order: Settings, connectivity, bootstrap, post-bootstrap readiness, Bronze, Silver, Silver snapshot gate, and `GoldJob`.
- [ ] Runner accepts injected stage dependencies and can be tested without a live database.
- [ ] Stage selection validates prerequisites: Silver requires explicit Bronze snapshot/recovery input; Gold requires explicit valid Silver `source_snapshot_id`; unsupported combinations fail before mutation.
- [ ] Silver transformation/validation failure prevents Gold execution.
- [ ] Gold failure or KPI mismatch produces `FAILED` with `failed_stage="gold"`, preserves the last valid Gold publication, and does not roll back Bronze or Silver.
- [ ] Gold validation, KPI, constraint, and current-pointer mechanics remain inside `GoldJob`; the runner does not duplicate them.
- [ ] Runner preserves Gold `pipeline_snapshot_id`, `source_snapshot_id`, `gold_run_id`, `gold_load_id`, `gold_version`, pointer, KPI, constraint, and publication fields.
- [ ] Stage-level errors retain stage, table, dependency, and root-cause context.
- [ ] Pipeline result aggregates statuses, counts, timings, publication state, and errors without exposing secrets.

### 7.3 CLI, exit code, and reports

- [ ] CLI help documents mode, stage selection, log level, report output, prerequisites, and exit behavior.
- [ ] Invalid CLI options fail before the runner starts and return non-zero.
- [ ] Exit code `0` is returned for `SUCCESS` and policy-approved `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` only.
- [ ] `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` returns non-zero for a full pipeline and is not downstream-eligible.
- [ ] Health, bootstrap, stage, validation, and publication failures return non-zero.
- [ ] JSON summary is machine-readable and includes `run_id`, final status, stage results, Gold identity/version/pointer fields, counts, durations, failure context, and report path.
- [ ] Markdown summary is readable and identifies failed stage, reason, counts, and publication state.
- [ ] JSON and Markdown are rendered from the same structured result and contain no password, credential-bearing connection string, or full raw payload.
- [ ] Report generation failure is a non-success delivery outcome and returns non-zero.

### 7.4 Test separation and CI

- [ ] Database-dependent tests carry the `integration` marker.
- [ ] `python -m pytest -m "not integration" -q` is deterministic without PostgreSQL/SQL Server.
- [ ] CI runs unit tests, lint, format, and type-check commands agreed by the repository.
- [ ] Integration CI explicitly provisions or checks PostgreSQL/SQL Server prerequisites.
- [ ] Environment-unavailable integration failures are visible and not reported as application success; local unit selection may skip them only with an explicit prerequisite reason.
- [ ] CI retains actionable test/report artifacts while excluding secrets.

### 7.5 Documentation and operations

- [ ] README contains the supported one-command pipeline invocation and environment setup.
- [ ] Runbook documents health failure, bootstrap/version mismatch, rerun, staging cleanup, rollback/preservation, and report lookup.
- [ ] Phase 4 master checklist links Phase 4E implementation and evidence and does not mark unverified work as done.
- [ ] Documentation matches actual CLI help, exit codes, report fields, and stage order.

python -m pytest -m "not integration" -q
python -m pytest tests/test_architecture_contract.py tests/test_phase4a_w0_contract.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_runner.py tests/test_pipeline_cli.py tests/test_bootstrap.py tests/test_health_gate.py -q

```

The focused command names are targets for the implementation. Update them in this document when the final module/test names are approved. Do not claim a command passed until its output is recorded in the evidence log.

## 9. Definition of Done for Phase 4E

Phase 4E is complete only when all applicable items below have implementation and evidence:

- [ ] Settings/connectivity is a hard gate before bootstrap, and post-bootstrap schema/metadata/version readiness is a hard gate before data processing.
- [ ] Bootstrap is real, idempotent, versioned, and non-destructive to published data.
- [ ] `PipelineRunner` coordinates all required stages with explicit failure policy and does not duplicate GoldJob mechanics.
- [ ] Silver snapshot validation is a pipeline gate; Gold validation/KPI/publication remains inside `GoldJob` and its result is a pipeline gate.
- [ ] CLI supports documented modes/stage selection and rejects invalid options.
- [ ] Exit code `0` is limited to `SUCCESS` and policy-approved `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS`; full-run `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` and `FAILED` are non-zero.
- [ ] JSON and Markdown summary reports are generated from one structured result, preserve Gold identity/version/pointer fields, and are redacted; delivery failure is non-success.
- [ ] Integration tests are marked and unit tests run without external services; unavailable integration prerequisites are explicit and block Production DoD.
- [ ] CI runs the agreed unit, lint, format, type-check, and integration-aware checks.
- [ ] README/runbook/checklist reflect actual commands, prerequisites, recovery, and evidence.

Production DoD must not be inferred from a fake-stage success test alone. Health gating, bootstrap idempotency/version checks, failure sequencing, exit codes, report redaction, integration classification, and documentation/runtime agreement all require evidence.

## 10. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Health result is advisory only | Unsafe partial processing | Pre-bootstrap hard-gate test asserts zero bootstrap/data calls; post-bootstrap readiness test asserts zero data calls |
| Bootstrap reports success without preparing schema | Late runtime failures | Idempotent DDL/version integration checks |
| Runner duplicates stage logic | Divergent behavior from jobs | Keep mechanics in stage services and use dependency injection |
| Stage selection bypasses dependencies | Inconsistent Silver/Gold snapshot | Require explicit Bronze recovery input for Silver and explicit `source_snapshot_id` for Gold |
| Partial result maps to exit `0` | Scheduler records false success | `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` is non-zero and not downstream-eligible; verify with subprocess tests |
| Reports expose secrets | Credential leakage in artifacts | Safe serializers and redaction tests |
| Report generation fails after stage execution | Delivery evidence is missing but process reports success | Treat report failure as non-success and test the delivery boundary |
| Integration tests run by default | Local/CI instability | Register marker and document unit-first command |
| CI lacks database services | False confidence or opaque failures | Separate service-backed job with prerequisite diagnostics |
| Docs drift from runtime | Operators run unsafe commands | Compare README/runbook with CLI help in evidence review |

## 11. Evidence log

Update this table after each task. A task may be marked `Done` only after implementation, focused tests, and relevant regression/CI evidence are recorded.
