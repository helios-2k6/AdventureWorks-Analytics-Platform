# Phase 4C - Silver Layer Impact and Execution Plan

## 1. Purpose

This document translates the approved Phase 4 Silver baseline into an implementation scope, impact analysis, task breakdown, and verifiable acceptance criteria.

Phase 4C covers:

1. Encapsulate Silver transformation as an injectable job/service.
2. Read Bronze in controlled chunks and apply deterministic pandas transformations.
3. Validate input schema and row-level conversion errors.
4. Quarantine isolatable row-level transformation errors.
5. Perform global deduplication on complete Silver staging data.
6. Make Silver validation a publication gate and publish atomically.
7. Run focused Silver regression tests and the appropriate repository regression suite.

Phase 4C does not redesign the Gold layer, change the approved Silver business model without a recorded decision, or remove legacy callable functions before compatibility evidence exists.

## 2. Baseline and current implementation

### 2.1 Confirmed implementation surface

| Area | Current location | Current behavior | Phase 4C concern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Silver cleaners | `scripts/transformation/silver/sales_silver_clean.py` | Six `clean_*` functions transform pandas DataFrames | Keep pure transformation behavior reusable while adding explicit contracts and error reporting |
| Silver orchestration | `scripts/transformation/silver/sales_silver_clean.py:run()` | Opens a connector, reads each Bronze table, transforms it, and writes directly to Silver | No injectable job/service or standard result |
| Bronze read | `_read_bronze()` | Uses `pd.read_sql_query()` without `chunksize` | Full Bronze table is loaded into memory |
| Type conversion | Cleaner functions | Uses `errors="coerce"` for dates and numeric values | Invalid source values can become NULL without a rejection reason |
| Deduplication | `_deduplicate()` | Uses `drop_duplicates(..., keep="last")` per DataFrame | Deduplication is not global across chunks and ordering is not explicit |
| Silver write | `run()` | Uses `to_sql(..., if_exists="replace")` against the published Silver schema | A failure can expose a partial or replaced Silver table |
| Person enrichment | `clean_sales_person()` and `run()` | Missing Person data prints a warning and falls back to the ID as a name | Approved baseline requires Person dependency failure unless degraded mode is explicitly approved |
| Validation | `scripts/transformation/silver/validate_silver.py` | Performs count, duplicate, NULL, and join checks against published tables | Validation is a standalone report, not a pre-publish gate |
| Shared contracts | `src/shared/ingestion/` | Provides settings, result/status, staging, audit, retry, checkpoint, and reconciliation foundations | Silver must reuse these contracts rather than create parallel mechanics |
| Existing tests | `tests/test_sales_silver.py` | Tests cleaner-level rename, conversion, trimming, and local dedup behavior | Tests need expansion for chunking, contracts, quarantine, staging, publish safety, and reruns |

### 2.2 Falsifiable implementation hypothesis

The primary Silver reliability failures are controlled by `run()`, `_read_bronze()`, `_deduplicate()`, and the direct `to_sql(..., if_exists="replace")` path. A focused test that injects a chunk reader and staging writer should demonstrate that a failed transformation or validation leaves the existing published Silver unchanged. If that test cannot be made to pass without changing the database publication boundary, the implementation must move one hop deeper to the staging/publish service rather than patching the cleaner functions.

### 2.3 Current public compatibility surface

The following behavior must remain available during migration unless a separate compatibility decision is recorded:

- `clean_sales_order_header(frame)`
- `clean_sales_order_detail(frame)`
- `clean_customer(frame)`
- `clean_sales_territory(frame)`
- `clean_sales_person(frame, person_frame=None)`
- `clean_product(frame)`
- `run()` as a legacy entrypoint, delegating to the new Silver job/service
- `CLEANERS` and `SILVER_TABLES` where existing callers import them

The compatibility wrapper must delegate only. New batching, quarantine, retry, staging, and publication logic belongs in the new service and shared components.

```

### 3.1 Ownership boundaries

| Component | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `SilverJob` or `SilverTransformationJob` | Table order, dependencies, chunk execution, result aggregation, and Silver policy | Connection environment parsing or duplicated retry/staging mechanics |
| Silver table specifications | Source/target names, required columns, key, ordering key, output columns, conversion rules, and enrichment dependency | Runtime state and database transactions |
| Pure `clean_*` functions | Deterministic mapping, trim, type conversion helper behavior, and output shaping | Database reads/writes, publication, retries, or hidden fallback policy |
| Shared staging manager/publish service | Run-specific staging identity, lifecycle, validation guard, cleanup, and atomic publication | Sales-specific transformation rules |
| Silver validator | Input/output schema, null/key/row-loss checks, rejected threshold, and referential checks | Repairing invalid source data or silently dropping rows |
| Quarantine service | Persisting rejected identity, reason, source hash, batch identity, and transform version | Logging full raw payload by default |
| Pipeline runner | Calling Silver and stopping Gold when Silver is not publishable | Silver transformation internals |

### 3.2 Required standard result

Every Silver table result must serialize through the shared result contract and include at least:

```text
run_id, load_id, batch_id, stage, source_table, target_table,
status, rows_read, rows_written, rows_rejected, attempt_count,
started_at, finished_at, error_type, error_message
```

Required Silver statuses:

| Status | Silver meaning |
|---|---|
| `SUCCESS` | All chunks and full-table checks pass; no rejected rows |
| `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` | Valid rows pass, rejected rows are persisted, and the configured threshold explicitly allows publication |
| `FAILED` | System/schema/contract/validation error or rejected threshold exceeded; no new Silver version is published |
| `RETRYING` | A transient operation is being retried; it is not a terminal table result |
| `QUARANTINED` | Rejected-row evidence exists; the final table result must still resolve to `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` or `FAILED` |

## 4. Impact analysis

### 4.1 Code impact

| Impacted area | Expected change | Risk | Mitigation/evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Silver script | Extract orchestration into a job/service and retain a delegating `run()` wrapper | Existing scripts/tests may depend on constructor-free `run()` | Compatibility test and legacy wrapper delegation test |
| Transformation functions | Add required-column and conversion reporting without changing approved output names | Existing cleaner tests may expect current output and local behavior | Preserve cleaner signatures; add explicit validation around them and update only tests that encode obsolete safety behavior |
| Database read | Introduce `read_sql_query(..., chunksize=settings.batch_size)` or an injected chunk reader | Chunk boundaries can alter results if dedup is local | Cross-chunk duplicate test and database-side global dedup |
| Database write | Write only to run-specific Silver staging | Staging cleanup and transaction handling can leave orphan objects | Reuse `StagingManager`, audit, checkpoint, cleanup, and reconciliation contracts |
| Validation | Convert `validate_silver.py` checks into an injectable validation service/gate | Existing report may check published tables after destructive writes | Validate staging before publish; retain report rendering as a compatibility/reporting surface |
| Person enrichment | Make `bronze.person` an explicit dependency for salesperson transformation | Current fallback can hide missing upstream data | Fail closed by default; degraded mode requires a separate approved decision and test |
| Shared ingestion | Reuse standard identity/status/result/retry/publish contracts | Parallel Silver-only infrastructure would drift from Bronze/Gold | Architecture/import review and shared contract tests |
| Pipeline orchestration | Silver failure must prevent Gold execution | A result-only validation could still allow downstream execution | Fake-job sequencing test in the pipeline layer |

### 4.2 Data and operational impact

- Silver will be built under a run-specific staging identity; the previously published Silver version remains readable until atomic publication succeeds.
- A full Bronze-to-Silver row-count match is not always expected after valid quarantine or approved global deduplication. The result must distinguish source rows, valid rows, rejected rows, and deduplicated rows.
- Every rejected row must retain run/load/table/batch identity, record key or source hash, error type, reason, and transformation version.
- Conversion errors must not be hidden by `errors="coerce"`. Nulls allowed by the schema remain valid only when the input value was valid or explicitly nullable.
- Global deduplication must use a deterministic ordering rule, initially `_load_date DESC, _record_hash DESC`, unless a separately approved source-version rule supersedes it.
- Silver publication failure must leave the existing published Silver tables and their version metadata unchanged.
- Gold must consume only a complete, validated Silver snapshot/load.

### 4.3 Out of scope and decisions required

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Customer name semantics | Existing code derives `customer_name` from `account_number`. Do not silently redefine it in Phase 4C. Record a business decision before changing the rule; keep the current rule as a compatibility baseline. |
| Person degraded mode | Not enabled by default. Missing `bronze.person` fails salesperson transformation. A degraded mode needs explicit approval, configuration, report semantics, and tests. |
| Gold implementation | Out of scope except for enforcing the Silver-to-Gold validation gate. |
| Database migration deployment | DDL for persistent Silver quarantine/audit/staging may be implemented here, but production migration rollout is tracked with the shared/database delivery workstream. |
| Arbitrary per-table classes | Avoid. Use immutable table specifications unless a table has materially different transformation, dependency, or publication behavior. |

## 5. Dependencies and execution order

```text
W1-W3 centralized settings/shared contracts
    -> W4-W5 Bronze snapshot, audit, identity, and retry evidence
        -> 6.1 Silver job/table specifications
            -> 6.2 input contracts and chunk reader
                -> 6.3 deterministic transform and conversion validation
                    -> 6.4 quarantine and threshold policy
                        -> 6.5 staging/checkpoint and global dedup
                            -> 6.6 whole-table validation gate
                                -> 6.7 atomic publish and compatibility wrapper
                                    -> 6.8 focused/regression tests
```

Do not implement Silver retry or publication changes before staging identity and transaction boundaries are testable. Do not use chunk-local `drop_duplicates()` as the final deduplication strategy. Do not mark a Silver result successful if validation fails or if rejected rows are not persisted.

## 7. Verifiable acceptance criteria

### 7.1 Job and contract acceptance

- [ ] A Silver job/service accepts injected settings and dependencies and returns standard results for every attempted table.
- [ ] The legacy `run()` entrypoint delegates to the new service and existing cleaner imports remain available.
- [ ] Results include status, counts, duration/timestamps, error type/message, and run/load/batch identity.
- [ ] Missing Bronze table, missing required column, missing Person dependency, and system errors fail closed with table context.

### 7.2 Read and transformation acceptance

- [ ] Canonical Silver reads use controlled chunks with `Settings.batch_size`, initially 10,000 rows.
- [ ] Canonical reads use stable ordering and do not use `fetchall()`, offset checkpoints, or page-number resume.
- [ ] Transform output is deterministic for the same Bronze snapshot and transformation version, regardless of chunk boundaries.
- [ ] Required source conversion failures are identified and rejected with field-level reason; `errors="coerce"` is not used as silent error handling.
- [ ] Person enrichment is explicit and missing Person data does not silently produce salesperson names from IDs.

### 7.3 Quarantine and dedup acceptance

- [ ] Valid rows from a mixed batch are staged while invalid rows are persisted to `silver.rejected_records` or the approved equivalent.
- [ ] Each rejection includes run/load/table/batch identity, record key or source hash, reason, error type, transform version, and timestamp.
- [ ] Rejected threshold defaults to `0` and is visible in the result/audit; publication status is `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` only when policy allows it.
- [ ] Duplicate keys spanning two or more chunks are handled by one global deterministic staging rule, not independent chunk deduplication.
- [ ] A duplicate `sales_order_detail_id` that violates the approved rule fails closed rather than being silently dropped.

### 7.4 Reliability and publication acceptance

- [ ] A transient read/write failure retries the same logical chunk with the same run/load/batch identity.
- [ ] A deterministic schema, contract, or validation error is not retried.
- [ ] An unknown commit outcome is reconciled before another write attempt.
- [ ] Checkpoint advancement occurs only after the corresponding staging data commit succeeds.
- [ ] Silver staging is run-specific and is not visible as the published Silver version during processing.
- [ ] A transformation, validation, constraint, or publish failure leaves the previous published Silver unchanged.
- [ ] Atomic publish occurs only after full staging validation passes.
- [ ] Failed or abandoned staging is marked/cleaned according to the shared lifecycle policy.

### 7.5 Pipeline and security acceptance

- [ ] Silver validation is a required pipeline gate; Gold is not called after Silver failure.
- [ ] Structured logs include applicable run/stage/table/load/batch/attempt/status/count fields.
- [ ] Passwords, full connection strings, and full raw rejected payloads do not appear in logs or rendered reports.
- [ ] A machine-readable summary identifies source count, valid count, rejected count, deduplicated count, publication status, and errors.

## 8. Test matrix and commands

### 8.1 Required scenarios

| Scenario | Test type | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| Valid cleaner transformation | Unit | Existing column mapping, trimming, flags, and types remain correct |
| Bronze table contains more than one chunk | Unit | Reader requests configured chunk size and yields stable ordered chunks |
| Canonical path inspection | Unit/static review | No `fetchall()`, full-table `read_sql_query()` without chunksize, or direct published `replace` write |
| Missing input table/column | Unit/integration | Table result is `FAILED`; no whole-table quarantine; old Silver remains |
| Invalid numeric/date value | Unit | Row is quarantined with field/reason; valid rows continue |
| Rejected threshold exceeded | Unit/integration | Result is `FAILED`; staging is not published |
| Duplicate across chunk boundary | Unit/integration | Global staging dedup applies deterministic rule once |
| Missing Person dependency | Unit/integration | Salesperson transformation fails closed; no ID-name fallback |
| Transient read/write error | Unit | Same logical batch retries with bounded attempts and recorded outcome |
| Unknown commit | Integration | Reconciliation prevents duplicate staging rows |
| Checkpoint ordering | Unit/integration | Checkpoint is written only after data commit |
| Silver validation failure | Unit/integration | Existing Silver remains unchanged and Gold is not invoked |
| Successful atomic publish | Integration | Complete validated staging becomes published Silver |
| Same input rerun | Integration | Published output is deterministic and has no duplicate logical keys |
| Secret/redaction behavior | Unit | Password and full raw payload are absent from logs/reports |

### 8.2 Suggested commands

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/test_sales_silver.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_sales_silver.py tests/test_ingestion_models.py tests/test_retry_policy.py tests/test_staging_manager.py tests/test_checkpoint_manager.py tests/test_audit_service.py -q
python -m pytest -m "not integration" -q
python -m pytest -q
```

Add new focused test files only when they make the contract easier to locate. Suggested names are:

```text
tests/test_silver_job.py
tests/test_silver_chunking.py
tests/test_silver_quarantine.py
tests/test_silver_publish.py
tests/test_silver_retry.py
tests/test_silver_validation.py
```

Integration tests must be marked with the repository integration marker and must record PostgreSQL/SQL Server availability separately from unit-test results.

## 9. Definition of Done for Phase 4C

Phase 4C is complete only when all applicable items below have implementation and test evidence:

- [ ] Silver is callable through an injectable job/service and the legacy entrypoint delegates to it.
- [ ] Bronze is read in controlled chunks of 10,000 rows by default with stable ordering.
- [ ] Transformations are deterministic and independent of chunk boundaries.
- [ ] Input schema and output schema contracts fail closed with actionable context.
- [ ] Conversion errors are detected rather than silently coerced.
- [ ] Row-level rejected records are persisted with identity, reason, and transformation version.
- [ ] Rejected threshold and `SUCCESS_WITH_REJECTIONS` behavior are explicit and tested.
- [ ] Global deduplication occurs after all chunks are staged using a deterministic rule.
- [ ] Shared retry, reconciliation, audit, checkpoint, and staging contracts are reused.
- [ ] Silver validation executes before publication and blocks downstream Gold on failure.
- [ ] Atomic publish preserves the previously published Silver when a build or validation fails.
- [ ] Failed/abandoned staging cleanup behavior is tested.
- [ ] Focused Silver unit tests pass without external services.
- [ ] Appropriate integration tests pass when database prerequisites are available, or are clearly recorded as environment-blocked.
- [ ] Logs and reports are structured and redacted.
- [ ] README/runbook and the Phase 4 master checklist match the implemented runtime behavior.

Production DoD must not be inferred from cleaner unit tests alone; staging transaction, quarantine persistence, retry/reconciliation, validation gate, rerun, and publish-preservation evidence are required.

## 10. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Dedup performed per chunk | Duplicate business keys survive across chunk boundaries | Stage all valid chunks, then apply SQL window/global dedup |
| Invalid values coerced to NULL | Data quality defects are hidden | Compare source validity with converted output and quarantine invalid rows |
| Missing Person fallback | Salesperson quality silently degrades | Fail closed unless a documented degraded mode is approved |
| Direct `replace` write | Existing Silver becomes partial or unavailable | Run-specific staging and atomic publish |
| Unknown write commit | Retry creates duplicate rows | Reconcile staging/audit/idempotency identity before retry |
| Silver count mismatch | Valid quarantine or dedup is mistaken for data loss | Report source, rejected, deduplicated, and published counts separately |
| Cleaner API break | Existing tests/scripts stop working | Keep signatures and use a delegating compatibility wrapper |
| Large Bronze table | Memory pressure and slow transformation | Chunked read and bounded staging writes; keep global state in database |
| Validation checks published tables | Failure is detected after destructive write | Run all required checks against staging before publication |
| Business rule ambiguity | Incorrect customer/person semantics | Keep current behavior unless decision is recorded; mark unresolved scope explicitly |
